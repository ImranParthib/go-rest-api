# Products Frontend with Remax

This is a Remax-based frontend for the Go REST API that displays products.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
```
npm install
```

2. Start the development server:
```
npm run dev
```

3. Make sure the Go API server is running on port 8080.

4. Open your browser to view the app (check the console for the URL, typically http://localhost:3000).

## Build for production

```
npm run build
```

This will generate production-ready files in the 'dist' directory.
